There was so much complexity that I usually spent extra hours after each session going through the work. I admit that this complexity made it somewhat intimidating at times, especially when I had to view all this alongside my other subjects. Further, some technical problems were encountered, for instance, software problems, loading libraries name errors, key errors and this added to the pressure of the schedule because more problems were caused.\n","#And all of this despite the problems that I have just mentioned, I liked many things about the assignment. I remember content engagement and also the level of curiosity and critical thinking I have obtained while working on this assignment. Putting theory into practice helped me internalize what I had learned and made the course more interesting. I had a chance to think creatively in addressing problems like coming up with new ideas. Another enjoyable aspect was the group work; it was nourishing to hear different perspectives, which enhanced my understanding.\n","#As for the time required to finish the assignment, I found it appropriate and satisfactory because it gave me a chance to analyze the topic deeply.

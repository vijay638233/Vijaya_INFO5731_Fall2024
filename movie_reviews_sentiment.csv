1,"""Hugh Jackman is the perfect Wolverine. What a fun movie. I like the dialogue and clever quips with f bombs sprinkled in. It's definitely not taking itself too seriously. There is tons of fun cameos I didn't expect! I normally watch spoiler videos ahead of time, but I didn't on this occasion and I'm glad I didn't because there was some oh snap moments! It's a very good action packed fun film. The breaking the Fox jokes and speaking to the camera jokes are too funny. I can definitely see more sequels for these two on the horizon. They are promoting this movie hard I just watched these two on Hot Ones eating chicken wings They make a dynamic duo.

3,"What I can say about this movie is that they (the whole team behind the movie) never hesitated a second to go all in, with everything they have in stores, throwing the kitchen sink in there and everything else.What's to love is how highly satisfying the movie is from the very first to the very last second, when it comes to all the little (or not so little) winks at the audience, especially if you connect with the characters and their previous iterations...But what you can really appreciate and which makes the entire movie (and scenes / story bits) more enjoyable is the whole emotional layer of it and really fun connections that occur (the come-back or introduction of various characters was so well done and really great to see) ...These guys clearly know what they are doing.Between the one-liners and the endless flow of jokes... The chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman knocks it out of the park !It is so overflowingly cray-cray and the frame is oh so overfilled with stuffs...Oh, and the tone of the movie is something else !The intro sequence is a masterpiece... The """"corridor"""" type of fight scene (that's in fact in a street) around the end the movie, it's just...a banquet of madness.Plus, the soundtrack is -like in the previous movies- super satisfying.I am quite excited for what there is to come next in the MCU and for these characters we've seen in this movie...""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,"""We've waited so long for this moment, and it was beyond fun, wholesome, full of surprises, emotional and epic! Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman and Shawn Levy pour out their hearts for this movie to be what is it.It's beyond the MCU timeline, it's beyond even FOX's """"X-Men"""" movies. It's about all the kids who grew up with these movies and these characters. The kids, who are now adults, but still love every bit of it.You know it's going to be fun with these two, but man... I laughed so hard, even my stomach was feeling it. And the jokes... be sure this is not Deadpool watered down in the MCU, it's Deadpool at its best. The inevitable bromance unveiled before our eyes. The story is fine, nothing special, but you feel it, and knowing the past knowledge about these characters and their respective universes makes everything hit the emotions.What about the cameos, you'd ask, I guess? Well, we already know about a bunch of them, but be sure, there's a bunch more and even the ones we already knew are more than what meets the eye.Emma Corrin as the villain Cassandra Nova is such a good addition to the movie and to the MCU as a whole. She is smart, strong, cold-blooded and also makes fun of our two leads.The action and the visuals are beyond amazing. There are some really, really creative scenes, where adamantium swords and claws create such a mayhem, that makes everything so bloody!The music choice is great and fun, at times could crack you so much. The opening scene is pure gold!Can't praise the movie enough, but """"Deadpool & Wolverine"""" is definitely in my top 5 cinema experiences, and you can easily guess the other ones. The whole theater was laughing, cheering and sobbing like a one person. What more could you ask for? Also, the movie got such a rewatchability factor, the length is perfect and be sure it will make tons of money! You can't possibly catch all the details in the first viewing for sure, but you will want to, so you'll go again and again... and again.What about the credit scene, you might ask? I kind of don't want to say anything about it because I don't want to spoil even the possible direction your thought is taking. Just stay for it, also during the credits there is something really beautiful. It's nowhere near """"fun filler"""", it's not """"Infinity War"""" level too, but it's a great movie, and it's one of MCU's finest!""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,"""So many Easter Eggs, so true to the comic characters, and may have possibly single handedly saved the MCU. Everything you'd expect from a deadpool movie plus.

Ridiculous deaths, sarcasms, obnoxious non PC comments and most importantly the most amazing music which brings it all together.And Deapool and Wolverine has that on every possible way.If you want to see this film, go to the cinema, don't wait for TV because you will miss one of the biggest and best watches to ever hit the big screen.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The story can be a little confusing, but it was fun all the way, I didn't feel bored even for a second. The action was very bloody and goofy, the jokes were hardcore and the movie is very meta. The one thing I especially liked is that there are actually emotional scene that aren't actually undercut with jokes, a thing that a lot of newer MCU movies tend to do. But this is still more of a Fox than a MCU movie. If you liked previous Deadpool movies you'll like this one too.

I'm confident that it's the best movie of the summer!The whole audience was constantly either laughing, cheering or clapping.

I won't spoil anything, but there were multiple cameos by characters you'll never see in any other movie, and I loved them. Fans of comic book movies will have a field day with all the references.It might be recency bias, but it's probably my favourite Deadpool movie (and I loved the first two).

9,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6. This film I kind of count as a stand-alone film and not a """"Deadpool 3"""", the first 2 in my opinion are much more enjoyable.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film. And that says a lot.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"""Story was a 4/10 max. I genuinely got bored and if Ryan Reynolds wasn't there to make it actually funny I probably would've walked out. The fact I'm giving them 2 starts on top of the 4 just because it was funny is crazy.I don't know when Marvel will learn that this multi-verse is ruining them. They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that. Disney is like the franchise just buying companies and just eating away at them until there is nothing left.

13,"""So that was a trip. I really enjoyed that film, and think both casual and hardcore fans will be pleased. Not perfect, but still pretty darn entertaining. There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The constant fourth wall breaking was timed perfectly & constant laughs along the way. It was a wonderful tribute throughout to some of the forgotten heroes in other films. Wolverine wearing the suit was great but the line """"Friends don't let friends leave home looking like they fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams."""" is incredible. The constant shots at other studios or the failures of marvel since Endgame was funny & something I wasn't sure we'd see in a Marvel Studios production but it made it even better. The whole movie is really just a bunch of fun as you'd expect with some epic action sequences along the way. If you loved the first two, you're going to love this, if you didn't then I'd skip it as it really cranks up what makes deadpool, deadpool. The movie is one big Easter egg so make sure you're locked in to everything going on. One of my favourite lines in the film """"Pegging isn't new for me, but it is for Disney"""" perfect delivery.

20,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic!

I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit.

22,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors. But hey, Deadpool & Wolverine has plenty to look out for. The stakes are higher, the villain is formidable and the titular characters' arcs are just golden.Deadpool being Deadpool, it's such a treat watching",Positive,really feels like Deadpool,is directing this movie.

The fight choreography, music, jokes, Easter eggs, and CGI were really great.Here are a few negatives about the movie.1. The trailers after the second one weren't necessary; based on the final trailer, I expected a bit more but was cautious.2.

29,"What I can say about this movie is that they (the whole team behind the movie) never hesitated a second to go all in, with everything they have in stores, throwing the kitchen sink in there and everything else.What's to love is how highly satisfying the movie is from the very first to the very last second, when it comes to all the little (or not so little) winks at the audience, especially if you connect with the characters and their previous iterations...But what you can really appreciate and which makes the entire movie (and scenes / story bits) more enjoyable is the whole emotional layer of it and really fun connections that occur (the come-back or introduction of various characters was so well done and really great to see) ...These guys clearly know what they are doing.Between the one-liners and the endless flow of jokes... The chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman knocks it out of the park !It is so overflowingly cray-cray and the frame is oh so overfilled with stuffs...Oh, and the tone of the movie is something else !The intro sequence is a masterpiece... The """"corridor"""" type of fight scene (that's in fact in a street) around the end the movie, it's just...a banquet of madness.Plus, the soundtrack is -like in the previous movies- super satisfying.I am quite excited for what there is to come next in the MCU and for these characters we've seen in this movie...""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman and Shawn Levy pour out their hearts for this movie to be what is it.It's beyond the MCU timeline, it's beyond even FOX's """"X-Men"""" movies. It's about all the kids who grew up with these movies and these characters. The kids, who are now adults, but still love every bit of it.You know it's going to be fun with these two, but man... I laughed so hard, even my stomach was feeling it. And the jokes... be sure this is not Deadpool watered down in the MCU, it's Deadpool at its best. The inevitable bromance unveiled before our eyes. The story is fine, nothing special, but you feel it, and knowing the past knowledge about these characters and their respective universes makes everything hit the emotions.What about the cameos, you'd ask, I guess? Well, we already know about a bunch of them, but be sure, there's a bunch more and even the ones we already knew are more than what meets the eye.Emma Corrin as the villain Cassandra Nova is such a good addition to the movie and to the MCU as a whole. She is smart, strong, cold-blooded and also makes fun of our two leads.The action and the visuals are beyond amazing. There are some really, really creative scenes, where adamantium swords and claws create such a mayhem, that makes everything so bloody!The music choice is great and fun, at times could crack you so much. The opening scene is pure gold!Can't praise the movie enough, but """"Deadpool & Wolverine"""" is definitely in my top 5 cinema experiences, and you can easily guess the other ones.

You can't possibly catch all the details in the first viewing for sure, but you will want to, so you'll go again and again... and again.What about the credit scene, you might ask? I kind of don't want to say anything about it because I don't want to spoil even the possible direction your thought is taking.

35,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6. This film I kind of count as a stand-alone film and not a """"Deadpool 3"""", the first 2 in my opinion are much more enjoyable.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film.

They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wolverine wearing the suit was great but the line """"Friends don't let friends leave home looking like they fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams."""" is incredible. The constant shots at other studios or the failures of marvel since Endgame was funny & something I wasn't sure we'd see in a Marvel Studios production but it made it even better.

The PERFECT team up, straight out of the MCU comic book genre!Emma Corrin played the best supervillain role as Cassandra Nova, and she literally nailed that part so brilliantly, and Matthew Macfadyen did a pretty good job as Mr. Paradox, and I never knew how the TVA can go from a whole new direction in the film. The ACTION, the COMEDY, the SPECTACLE, the JOKES, the GORE, and every best Marvel moments was beautifully well done by the book when it comes to Kevin Feige, and along with the MCU team, that can actually make many Marvel movies possible, to keep Stan Lee's name and his legacy alive!Shawn Levy, who made Free Guy, Night at the Museum films, Real Steel, and The Adam Project, did a really great job making his version of Deadpool happen on the BIG SCREEN, and we finally got what the Marvel fans wanted! Everything with Marvel Studios was brilliant, I'm not gonna say anything about it tho, so NO SPOILERS, lmao, but this was definitely the best buddy superhero movie of 2024, and I would love to go see D&W, over and over and over and over again!LFG!10/10..... more like: 1000/10!""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,"""We saw this at the midnight premiere in imperial Copenhagen, it was a fun experience meeting people in the middle of the night for a new movie, and assembling fans who enjoy this franchise as much as ourselves.The movie in its entirety was very enjoyable, but it seemed like they just had to come up with something for the fun of it. Don't get me wrong, Ryan Reynolds does a phenomenal job, and the some scenes are just way to hilarious. But it lacked something which i somehow can't explain, it just seemed like they could have come up with a better story imo. But what do I know?I say go for it, and at least you end up laughing.""",Neutrral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic! Hearing Green",Positive,life whilst showing behind,the scenes footage of the fox/marvel,films was a really heartfelt goodbye,"to the Fox universe. Instead of insulting them, it was a celebration of them and felt like",a fitting,"goodbye.Anyways, as",much,as Deadpool and Wolverine is a,messy,movie with a,"flawed story,",its just,too,fun to really,care to,much,about that. The fact that this exists is,just so cool for comic book fans and,I had an absolute blast watching the midnight premiere and even my,rewatch,of it.Oh I forgot,"to mention how this had an absolute GOATED soundtrack, Green Day, Avril Lavigne and a song from",the,"movie Grease (1978)...WOW!!!!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,"""This is the first Marvel movie in a long time that didn't make me want to fast-forward to the end. It runs on fan service, cameos and everything that came before. I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit. This movie isn't going to fix anything like a lot of people thought it would. Not as good as 1, but better than 2. I'll probably watch it again.""",Neutral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors. But hey, Deadpool & Wolverine has plenty to look out for.

The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6.

62,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film.

63,"""Story was a 4/10 max. I genuinely got bored and if Ryan Reynolds wasn't there to make it actually funny I probably would've walked out. The fact I'm giving them 2 starts on top of the 4 just because it was funny is crazy.I don't know when Marvel will learn that this multi-verse is ruining them. They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that. Disney is like the franchise just buying companies and just eating away at them until there is nothing left.

65,"""So that was a trip. I really enjoyed that film, and think both casual and hardcore fans will be pleased. Not perfect, but still pretty darn entertaining. There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cameos are, as far as I'm concerned, awesome as well.And one more thing - pacing is also spot on - 2 hours flew by.I'll keep it short - just go and watch it!""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The constant fourth wall breaking was timed perfectly & constant laughs along the way. It was a wonderful tribute throughout to some of the forgotten heroes in other films. Wolverine wearing the suit was great but the line """"Friends don't let friends leave home looking like they fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams."""" is incredible. The constant shots at other studios or the failures of marvel since Endgame was funny & something I wasn't sure we'd see in a Marvel Studios production but it made it even better. The whole movie is really just a bunch of fun as you'd expect with some epic action sequences along the way. If you loved the first two, you're going to love this, if you didn't then I'd skip it as it really cranks up what makes deadpool, deadpool. The movie is one big Easter egg so make sure you're locked in to everything going on. One of my favourite lines in the film """"Pegging isn't new for me, but it is for Disney"""" perfect delivery.

Don't get me wrong, Ryan Reynolds does a phenomenal job, and the some scenes are just way to hilarious.

72,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic!

73,"""This is the first Marvel movie in a long time that didn't make me want to fast-forward to the end. It runs on fan service, cameos and everything that came before. I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit. This movie isn't going to fix anything like a lot of people thought it would. Not as good as 1, but better than 2.

74,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors.

The opening scene is pure gold!Can't praise the movie enough, but """"Deadpool & Wolverine"""" is definitely in my top 5 cinema experiences, and you can easily guess the other ones. The whole theater was laughing, cheering and sobbing like a one person. What more could you ask for? Also, the movie got such a rewatchability factor, the length is perfect and be sure it will make tons of money! You can't possibly catch all the details in the first viewing for sure, but you will want to, so you'll go again and again... and again.What about the credit scene, you might ask? I kind of don't want to say anything about it because I don't want to spoil even the possible direction your thought is taking. Just stay for it, also during the credits there is something really beautiful. It's nowhere near """"fun filler"""", it's not """"Infinity War"""" level too, but it's a great movie, and it's one of MCU's finest!""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The one thing I especially liked is that there are actually emotional scene that aren't actually undercut with jokes, a thing that a lot of newer MCU movies tend to do. But this is still more of a Fox than a MCU movie. If you liked previous Deadpool movies you'll like this one too.

87,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6. This film I kind of count as a stand-alone film and not a """"Deadpool 3"""", the first 2 in my opinion are much more enjoyable.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film.

They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wolverine wearing the suit was great but the line """"Friends don't let friends leave home looking like they fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams."""" is incredible. The constant shots at other studios or the failures of marvel since Endgame was funny & something I wasn't sure we'd see in a Marvel Studios production but it made it even better.

98,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic!

It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit.

100,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
101,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors.

It's about all the kids who grew up with these movies and these characters. The kids, who are now adults, but still love every bit of it.You know it's going to be fun with these two, but man...

113,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6. This film I kind of count as a stand-alone film and not a """"Deadpool 3"""", the first 2 in my opinion are much more enjoyable.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
114,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film.

They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic! Hearing Green",Positive,life whilst showing behind,the scenes footage of the fox/marvel,films was a really heartfelt goodbye,"to the Fox universe.

125,"""This is the first Marvel movie in a long time that didn't make me want to fast-forward to the end. It runs on fan service, cameos and everything that came before. I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit. This movie isn't going to fix anything like a lot of people thought it would. Not as good as 1, but better than 2. I'll probably watch it again.""",Neutral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
126,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
127,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors. But hey, Deadpool & Wolverine has plenty to look out for.

When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6.

140,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film.

They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
144,"""My first review.I'm not a huge Marvel fan, but I've watched all Deadpool and loved them.Don't know what it is about this one but I've found it hilarious, and it would seem that whole theatre did as well. All jokes are spot on, acting is awesome (with few exceptions), action is great - all in all a movie I would recommend to anyone who can stomach a bit of adult (and childish) humour and gore.Story is OK, nothing special, but execution makes up for it. Cameos are, as far as I'm concerned, awesome as well.And one more thing - pacing is also spot on - 2 hours flew by.I'll keep it short - just go and watch it!""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
145,"""Watched it on IMAX with my parents and it was definitely worth it. It was truly entertaining and fun. Smiling and laughing from the start till the end. Also, I never thought I would see some """"old"""" characters and """"old/new"""" characters in this film. Many easter eggs, if you're that nerd, truly nostalgic. I could say this is one of the best multiverse film ever. Also the soundtrack for this film was great. However, the movie should have been longer because we waited for many years for this prequel. When it ended, it was bittersweet because I grew up with these movies.

146,"""The opening sequence to this film is one of the best I've seen. Whole lot of fighting with Logan's bones & dancing to Bye Bye Bye, a masterpiece opening. The constant fourth wall breaking was timed perfectly & constant laughs along the way. It was a wonderful tribute throughout to some of the forgotten heroes in other films. Wolverine wearing the suit was great but the line """"Friends don't let friends leave home looking like they fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams."""" is incredible. The constant shots at other studios or the failures of marvel since Endgame was funny & something I wasn't sure we'd see in a Marvel Studios production but it made it even better. The whole movie is really just a bunch of fun as you'd expect with some epic action sequences along the way. If you loved the first two, you're going to love this, if you didn't then I'd skip it as it really cranks up what makes deadpool, deadpool. The movie is one big Easter egg so make sure you're locked in to everything going on. One of my favourite lines in the film """"Pegging isn't new for me, but it is for Disney"""" perfect delivery. If you want to get some closure on a gag from the film make sure you stay for the credit scene.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Charles sister one moment is touched because 1 of the infinite number of Charles might have cared she existed and releasing them from the void, to instantly following them to destroy everything just because she was written to.That being said if you just enjoy the cultural references and ride without thinking, it's a good film. There are many hilarious scenes and great fight scenes along with beautifully shot scenes. I saw it in imax 3d in Indy and the effects were really solid as well.

149,"""We saw this at the midnight premiere in imperial Copenhagen, it was a fun experience meeting people in the middle of the night for a new movie, and assembling fans who enjoy this franchise as much as ourselves.The movie in its entirety was very enjoyable, but it seemed like they just had to come up with something for the fun of it. Don't get me wrong, Ryan Reynolds does a phenomenal job, and the some scenes are just way to hilarious. But it lacked something which i somehow can't explain, it just seemed like they could have come up with a better story imo.

150,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic! Hearing Green",Positive,life whilst showing behind,the scenes footage of the fox/marvel,films was a really heartfelt goodbye,"to the Fox universe. Instead of insulting them, it was a celebration of them and felt like",a fitting,"goodbye.Anyways, as",much,as Deadpool and Wolverine is a,messy,movie with a,"flawed story,",its just,too,fun to really,care to,much,about that. The fact that this exists is,just so cool for comic book fans and,I had an absolute blast watching the midnight premiere and even my,rewatch,of it.Oh I forgot,"to mention how this had an absolute GOATED soundtrack, Green Day, Avril Lavigne and a song from",the,"movie Grease (1978)...WOW!!!!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
151,"""This is the first Marvel movie in a long time that didn't make me want to fast-forward to the end. It runs on fan service, cameos and everything that came before. I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit. This movie isn't going to fix anything like a lot of people thought it would. Not as good as 1, but better than 2. I'll probably watch it again.""",Neutral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
152,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
153,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors.

The one thing I especially liked is that there are actually emotional scene that aren't actually undercut with jokes, a thing that a lot of newer MCU movies tend to do. But this is still more of a Fox than a MCU movie. If you liked previous Deadpool movies you'll like this one too.

165,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6. This film I kind of count as a stand-alone film and not a """"Deadpool 3"""", the first 2 in my opinion are much more enjoyable.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
166,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film.

They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

176,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic!

It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit.

178,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
179,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors.

It did not make a lot of sense but I did not really matter, in the moment it was fun and funny! The jakes went a little further then normally to be honest but if you are a Deadpool fan that means extra fun! The movie started off great! And ended even greater! The movie was full of unsuspected moments (that I wont spoil). I went with my mom who does not know anything about marvel (only Spiderman) but had no problems following a few jokes here and there about moments from past films but nothing to worry about not being able to follow the movie.

It's a very good action packed fun film. The breaking the Fox jokes and speaking to the camera jokes are too funny. I can definitely see more sequels for these two on the horizon.

185,"What I can say about this movie is that they (the whole team behind the movie) never hesitated a second to go all in, with everything they have in stores, throwing the kitchen sink in there and everything else.What's to love is how highly satisfying the movie is from the very first to the very last second, when it comes to all the little (or not so little) winks at the audience, especially if you connect with the characters and their previous iterations...But what you can really appreciate and which makes the entire movie (and scenes / story bits) more enjoyable is the whole emotional layer of it and really fun connections that occur (the come-back or introduction of various characters was so well done and really great to see) ...These guys clearly know what they are doing.Between the one-liners and the endless flow of jokes... The chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman knocks it out of the park !It is so overflowingly cray-cray and the frame is oh so overfilled with stuffs...Oh, and the tone of the movie is something else !The intro sequence is a masterpiece... The """"corridor"""" type of fight scene (that's in fact in a street) around the end the movie, it's just...a banquet of madness.Plus, the soundtrack is -like in the previous movies- super satisfying.I am quite excited for what there is to come next in the MCU and for these characters we've seen in this movie...""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman and Shawn Levy pour out their hearts for this movie to be what is it.It's beyond the MCU timeline, it's beyond even FOX's """"X-Men"""" movies. It's about all the kids who grew up with these movies and these characters. The kids, who are now adults, but still love every bit of it.You know it's going to be fun with these two, but man... I laughed so hard, even my stomach was feeling it. And the jokes... be sure this is not Deadpool watered down in the MCU, it's Deadpool at its best. The inevitable bromance unveiled before our eyes. The story is fine, nothing special, but you feel it, and knowing the past knowledge about these characters and their respective universes makes everything hit the emotions.What about the cameos, you'd ask, I guess? Well, we already know about a bunch of them, but be sure, there's a bunch more and even the ones we already knew are more than what meets the eye.Emma Corrin as the villain Cassandra Nova is such a good addition to the movie and to the MCU as a whole. She is smart, strong, cold-blooded and also makes fun of our two leads.The action and the visuals are beyond amazing. There are some really, really creative scenes, where adamantium swords and claws create such a mayhem, that makes everything so bloody!The music choice is great and fun, at times could crack you so much. The opening scene is pure gold!Can't praise the movie enough, but """"Deadpool & Wolverine"""" is definitely in my top 5 cinema experiences, and you can easily guess the other ones. The whole theater was laughing, cheering and sobbing like a one person. What more could you ask for? Also, the movie got such a rewatchability factor, the length is perfect and be sure it will make tons of money! You can't possibly catch all the details in the first viewing for sure, but you will want to, so you'll go again and again... and again.What about the credit scene, you might ask? I kind of don't want to say anything about it because I don't want to spoil even the possible direction your thought is taking. Just stay for it, also during the credits there is something really beautiful.

The one thing I especially liked is that there are actually emotional scene that aren't actually undercut with jokes, a thing that a lot of newer MCU movies tend to do. But this is still more of a Fox than a MCU movie. If you liked previous Deadpool movies you'll like this one too.

191,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6. This film I kind of count as a stand-alone film and not a """"Deadpool 3"""", the first 2 in my opinion are much more enjoyable.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
192,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film. And that says a lot.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fact I'm giving them 2 starts on top of the 4 just because it was funny is crazy.I don't know when Marvel will learn that this multi-verse is ruining them. They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The constant fourth wall breaking was timed perfectly & constant laughs along the way. It was a wonderful tribute throughout to some of the forgotten heroes in other films. Wolverine wearing the suit was great but the line """"Friends don't let friends leave home looking like they fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams."""" is incredible. The constant shots at other studios or the failures of marvel since Endgame was funny & something I wasn't sure we'd see in a Marvel Studios production but it made it even better. The whole movie is really just a bunch of fun as you'd expect with some epic action sequences along the way. If you loved the first two, you're going to love this, if you didn't then I'd skip it as it really cranks up what makes deadpool, deadpool. The movie is one big Easter egg so make sure you're locked in to everything going on. One of my favourite lines in the film """"Pegging isn't new for me, but it is for Disney"""" perfect delivery.

202,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic!

It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit.

We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble.

The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
205,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors. But hey, Deadpool & Wolverine has plenty to look out for.

The chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman knocks it out of the park !It is so overflowingly cray-cray and the frame is oh so overfilled with stuffs...Oh, and the tone of the movie is something else !The intro sequence is a masterpiece...

Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman and Shawn Levy pour out their hearts for this movie to be what is it.It's beyond the MCU timeline, it's beyond even FOX's """"X-Men"""" movies. It's about all the kids who grew up with these movies and these characters. The kids, who are now adults, but still love every bit of it.You know it's going to be fun with these two, but man...

Well, we already know about a bunch of them, but be sure, there's a bunch more and even the ones we already knew are more than what meets the eye.Emma Corrin as the villain Cassandra Nova is such a good addition to the movie and to the MCU as a whole.

The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6.

218,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film.

I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

225,"""I felt like the story was weak and obviously things were happening just to progress the plot versus making sense. Charles sister one moment is touched because 1 of the infinite number of Charles might have cared she existed and releasing them from the void, to instantly following them to destroy everything just because she was written to.That being said if you just enjoy the cultural references and ride without thinking, it's a good film. There are many hilarious scenes and great fight scenes along with beautifully shot scenes. I saw it in imax 3d in Indy and the effects were really solid as well.

The ACTION, the COMEDY, the SPECTACLE, the JOKES, the GORE, and every best Marvel moments was beautifully well done by the book when it comes to Kevin Feige, and along with the MCU team, that can actually make many Marvel movies possible, to keep Stan Lee's name and his legacy alive!Shawn Levy, who made Free Guy, Night at the Museum films, Real Steel, and The Adam Project, did a really great job making his version of Deadpool happen on the BIG SCREEN, and we finally got what the Marvel fans wanted!

Don't get me wrong, Ryan Reynolds does a phenomenal job, and the some scenes are just way to hilarious.

228,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic! Hearing Green",Positive,life whilst showing behind,the scenes footage of the fox/marvel,films was a really heartfelt goodbye,"to the Fox universe. Instead of insulting them, it was a celebration of them and felt like",a fitting,"goodbye.Anyways, as",much,as Deadpool and Wolverine is a,messy,movie with a,"flawed story,",its just,too,fun to really,care to,much,about that. The fact that this exists is,just so cool for comic book fans and,I had an absolute blast watching the midnight premiere and even my,rewatch,of it.Oh I forgot,"to mention how this had an absolute GOATED soundtrack, Green Day, Avril Lavigne and a song from",the,"movie Grease (1978)...WOW!!!!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
229,"""This is the first Marvel movie in a long time that didn't make me want to fast-forward to the end. It runs on fan service, cameos and everything that came before. I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit. This movie isn't going to fix anything like a lot of people thought it would. Not as good as 1, but better than 2. I'll probably watch it again.""",Neutral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
230,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
231,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors. But hey, Deadpool & Wolverine has plenty to look out for.

243,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6. This film I kind of count as a stand-alone film and not a """"Deadpool 3"""", the first 2 in my opinion are much more enjoyable.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
244,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film. And that says a lot.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fact I'm giving them 2 starts on top of the 4 just because it was funny is crazy.I don't know when Marvel will learn that this multi-verse is ruining them. They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wolverine wearing the suit was great but the line """"Friends don't let friends leave home looking like they fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams."""" is incredible. The constant shots at other studios or the failures of marvel since Endgame was funny & something I wasn't sure we'd see in a Marvel Studios production but it made it even better.

If you loved the first two, you're going to love this, if you didn't then I'd skip it as it really cranks up what makes deadpool, deadpool. The movie is one big Easter egg so make sure you're locked in to everything going on. One of my favourite lines in the film """"Pegging isn't new for me, but it is for Disney"""" perfect delivery.

254,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic!

255,"""This is the first Marvel movie in a long time that didn't make me want to fast-forward to the end. It runs on fan service, cameos and everything that came before. I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit. This movie isn't going to fix anything like a lot of people thought it would. Not as good as 1, but better than 2.

256,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
257,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors.

The """"corridor"""" type of fight scene (that's in fact in a street) around the end the movie, it's just...a banquet of madness.Plus, the soundtrack is -like in the previous movies- super satisfying.I am quite excited for what there is to come next in the MCU and for these characters we've seen in this movie...""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
264,"""We've waited so long for this moment, and it was beyond fun, wholesome, full of surprises, emotional and epic! Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman and Shawn Levy pour out their hearts for this movie to be what is it.It's beyond the MCU timeline, it's beyond even FOX's """"X-Men"""" movies. It's about all the kids who grew up with these movies and these characters. The kids, who are now adults, but still love every bit of it.You know it's going to be fun with these two, but man... I laughed so hard, even my stomach was feeling it. And the jokes... be sure this is not Deadpool watered down in the MCU, it's Deadpool at its best. The inevitable bromance unveiled before our eyes. The story is fine, nothing special, but you feel it, and knowing the past knowledge about these characters and their respective universes makes everything hit the emotions.What about the cameos, you'd ask, I guess? Well, we already know about a bunch of them, but be sure, there's a bunch more and even the ones we already knew are more than what meets the eye.Emma Corrin as the villain Cassandra Nova is such a good addition to the movie and to the MCU as a whole. She is smart, strong, cold-blooded and also makes fun of our two leads.The action and the visuals are beyond amazing. There are some really, really creative scenes, where adamantium swords and claws create such a mayhem, that makes everything so bloody!The music choice is great and fun, at times could crack you so much. The opening scene is pure gold!Can't praise the movie enough, but """"Deadpool & Wolverine"""" is definitely in my top 5 cinema experiences, and you can easily guess the other ones. The whole theater was laughing, cheering and sobbing like a one person. What more could you ask for? Also, the movie got such a rewatchability factor, the length is perfect and be sure it will make tons of money! You can't possibly catch all the details in the first viewing for sure, but you will want to, so you'll go again and again... and again.What about the credit scene, you might ask? I kind of don't want to say anything about it because I don't want to spoil even the possible direction your thought is taking. Just stay for it, also during the credits there is something really beautiful. It's nowhere near """"fun filler"""", it's not """"Infinity War"""" level too, but it's a great movie, and it's one of MCU's finest!""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The one thing I especially liked is that there are actually emotional scene that aren't actually undercut with jokes, a thing that a lot of newer MCU movies tend to do. But this is still more of a Fox than a MCU movie. If you liked previous Deadpool movies you'll like this one too.

269,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6. This film I kind of count as a stand-alone film and not a """"Deadpool 3"""", the first 2 in my opinion are much more enjoyable.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
270,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film.

They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wolverine wearing the suit was great but the line """"Friends don't let friends leave home looking like they fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams."""" is incredible. The constant shots at other studios or the failures of marvel since Endgame was funny & something I wasn't sure we'd see in a Marvel Studios production but it made it even better.

280,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic!

It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit.

282,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
283,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane.

Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman and Shawn Levy pour out their hearts for this movie to be what is it.It's beyond the MCU timeline, it's beyond even FOX's """"X-Men"""" movies. It's about all the kids who grew up with these movies and these characters. The kids, who are now adults, but still love every bit of it.You know it's going to be fun with these two, but man... I laughed so hard, even my stomach was feeling it. And the jokes... be sure this is not Deadpool watered down in the MCU, it's Deadpool at its best. The inevitable bromance unveiled before our eyes. The story is fine, nothing special, but you feel it, and knowing the past knowledge about these characters and their respective universes makes everything hit the emotions.What about the cameos, you'd ask, I guess? Well, we already know about a bunch of them, but be sure, there's a bunch more and even the ones we already knew are more than what meets the eye.Emma Corrin as the villain Cassandra Nova is such a good addition to the movie and to the MCU as a whole. She is smart, strong, cold-blooded and also makes fun of our two leads.The action and the visuals are beyond amazing. There are some really, really creative scenes, where adamantium swords and claws create such a mayhem, that makes everything so bloody!The music choice is great and fun, at times could crack you so much. The opening scene is pure gold!Can't praise the movie enough, but """"Deadpool & Wolverine"""" is definitely in my top 5 cinema experiences, and you can easily guess the other ones.

Also, the movie got such a rewatchability factor, the length is perfect and be sure it will make tons of money! You can't possibly catch all the details in the first viewing for sure, but you will want to, so you'll go again and again... and again.What about the credit scene, you might ask? I kind of don't want to say anything about it because I don't want to spoil even the possible direction your thought is taking.

295,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6. This film I kind of count as a stand-alone film and not a """"Deadpool 3"""", the first 2 in my opinion are much more enjoyable.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
296,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film.

They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

306,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic! Hearing Green",Positive,life whilst showing behind,the scenes footage of the fox/marvel,films was a really heartfelt goodbye,"to the Fox universe. Instead of insulting them, it was a celebration of them and felt like",a fitting,"goodbye.Anyways, as",much,as Deadpool and Wolverine is a,messy,movie with a,"flawed story,",its just,too,fun to really,care to,much,about that. The fact that this exists is,just so cool for comic book fans and,I had an absolute blast watching the midnight premiere and even my,rewatch,of it.Oh I forgot,"to mention how this had an absolute GOATED soundtrack, Green Day, Avril Lavigne and a song from",the,"movie Grease (1978)...WOW!!!!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
307,"""This is the first Marvel movie in a long time that didn't make me want to fast-forward to the end. It runs on fan service, cameos and everything that came before. I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit. This movie isn't going to fix anything like a lot of people thought it would. Not as good as 1, but better than 2. I'll probably watch it again.""",Neutral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
308,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
309,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors. But hey, Deadpool & Wolverine has plenty to look out for.

When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6.

322,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film.

They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

325,"""So that was a trip. I really enjoyed that film, and think both casual and hardcore fans will be pleased. Not perfect, but still pretty darn entertaining. There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cameos are, as far as I'm concerned, awesome as well.And one more thing - pacing is also spot on - 2 hours flew by.I'll keep it short - just go and watch it!""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wolverine wearing the suit was great but the line """"Friends don't let friends leave home looking like they fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams."""" is incredible. The constant shots at other studios or the failures of marvel since Endgame was funny & something I wasn't sure we'd see in a Marvel Studios production but it made it even better. The whole movie is really just a bunch of fun as you'd expect with some epic action sequences along the way. If you loved the first two, you're going to love this, if you didn't then I'd skip it as it really cranks up what makes deadpool, deadpool. The movie is one big Easter egg so make sure you're locked in to everything going on. One of my favourite lines in the film """"Pegging isn't new for me, but it is for Disney"""" perfect delivery.

332,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic!

333,"""This is the first Marvel movie in a long time that didn't make me want to fast-forward to the end. It runs on fan service, cameos and everything that came before. I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit. This movie isn't going to fix anything like a lot of people thought it would. Not as good as 1, but better than 2.

334,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
335,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors.

The story can be a little confusing, but it was fun all the way, I didn't feel bored even for a second. The action was very bloody and goofy, the jokes were hardcore and the movie is very meta. The one thing I especially liked is that there are actually emotional scene that aren't actually undercut with jokes, a thing that a lot of newer MCU movies tend to do. But this is still more of a Fox than a MCU movie. If you liked previous Deadpool movies you'll like this one too.

347,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6. This film I kind of count as a stand-alone film and not a """"Deadpool 3"""", the first 2 in my opinion are much more enjoyable.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
348,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film. And that says a lot.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

358,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic!

It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit.

360,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
361,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors.

The motivation for why the TVA chose Deadpool is a bit weak, and the story of how Wolverine left the X-Men hanging is also too brief.3. Some scenes with Peter could have been omitted.""",Neutral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The movie was full of unsuspected moments (that I wont spoil). I went with my mom who does not know anything about marvel (only Spiderman) but had no problems following a few jokes here and there about moments from past films but nothing to worry about not being able to follow the movie.

367,"What I can say about this movie is that they (the whole team behind the movie) never hesitated a second to go all in, with everything they have in stores, throwing the kitchen sink in there and everything else.What's to love is how highly satisfying the movie is from the very first to the very last second, when it comes to all the little (or not so little) winks at the audience, especially if you connect with the characters and their previous iterations...But what you can really appreciate and which makes the entire movie (and scenes / story bits) more enjoyable is the whole emotional layer of it and really fun connections that occur (the come-back or introduction of various characters was so well done and really great to see) ...These guys clearly know what they are doing.Between the one-liners and the endless flow of jokes... The chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman knocks it out of the park !It is so overflowingly cray-cray and the frame is oh so overfilled with stuffs...Oh, and the tone of the movie is something else !The intro sequence is a masterpiece... The """"corridor"""" type of fight scene (that's in fact in a street) around the end the movie, it's just...a banquet of madness.Plus, the soundtrack is -like in the previous movies- super satisfying.I am quite excited for what there is to come next in the MCU and for these characters we've seen in this movie...""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman and Shawn Levy pour out their hearts for this movie to be what is it.It's beyond the MCU timeline, it's beyond even FOX's """"X-Men"""" movies. It's about all the kids who grew up with these movies and these characters. The kids, who are now adults, but still love every bit of it.You know it's going to be fun with these two, but man... I laughed so hard, even my stomach was feeling it. And the jokes... be sure this is not Deadpool watered down in the MCU, it's Deadpool at its best. The inevitable bromance unveiled before our eyes. The story is fine, nothing special, but you feel it, and knowing the past knowledge about these characters and their respective universes makes everything hit the emotions.What about the cameos, you'd ask, I guess? Well, we already know about a bunch of them, but be sure, there's a bunch more and even the ones we already knew are more than what meets the eye.Emma Corrin as the villain Cassandra Nova is such a good addition to the movie and to the MCU as a whole. She is smart, strong, cold-blooded and also makes fun of our two leads.The action and the visuals are beyond amazing. There are some really, really creative scenes, where adamantium swords and claws create such a mayhem, that makes everything so bloody!The music choice is great and fun, at times could crack you so much. The opening scene is pure gold!Can't praise the movie enough, but """"Deadpool & Wolverine"""" is definitely in my top 5 cinema experiences, and you can easily guess the other ones. The whole theater was laughing, cheering and sobbing like a one person. What more could you ask for? Also, the movie got such a rewatchability factor, the length is perfect and be sure it will make tons of money! You can't possibly catch all the details in the first viewing for sure, but you will want to, so you'll go again and again... and again.What about the credit scene, you might ask? I kind of don't want to say anything about it because I don't want to spoil even the possible direction your thought is taking. Just stay for it, also during the credits there is something really beautiful.

373,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6. This film I kind of count as a stand-alone film and not a """"Deadpool 3"""", the first 2 in my opinion are much more enjoyable.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
374,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film. And that says a lot.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wolverine wearing the suit was great but the line """"Friends don't let friends leave home looking like they fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams."""" is incredible. The constant shots at other studios or the failures of marvel since Endgame was funny & something I wasn't sure we'd see in a Marvel Studios production but it made it even better.

384,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic!

The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
387,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors. But hey, Deadpool & Wolverine has plenty to look out for.

When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6.

400,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film.

The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

407,"""I felt like the story was weak and obviously things were happening just to progress the plot versus making sense. Charles sister one moment is touched because 1 of the infinite number of Charles might have cared she existed and releasing them from the void, to instantly following them to destroy everything just because she was written to.That being said if you just enjoy the cultural references and ride without thinking, it's a good film. There are many hilarious scenes and great fight scenes along with beautifully shot scenes. I saw it in imax 3d in Indy and the effects were really solid as well.

The ACTION, the COMEDY, the SPECTACLE, the JOKES, the GORE, and every best Marvel moments was beautifully well done by the book when it comes to Kevin Feige, and along with the MCU team, that can actually make many Marvel movies possible, to keep Stan Lee's name and his legacy alive!Shawn Levy, who made Free Guy, Night at the Museum films, Real Steel, and The Adam Project, did a really great job making his version of Deadpool happen on the BIG SCREEN, and we finally got what the Marvel fans wanted!

Don't get me wrong, Ryan Reynolds does a phenomenal job, and the some scenes are just way to hilarious.

410,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic! Hearing Green",Positive,life whilst showing behind,the scenes footage of the fox/marvel,films was a really heartfelt goodbye,"to the Fox universe. Instead of insulting them, it was a celebration of them and felt like",a fitting,"goodbye.Anyways, as",much,as Deadpool and Wolverine is a,messy,movie with a,"flawed story,",its just,too,fun to really,care to,much,about that. The fact that this exists is,just so cool for comic book fans and,I had an absolute blast watching the midnight premiere and even my,rewatch,of it.Oh I forgot,"to mention how this had an absolute GOATED soundtrack, Green Day, Avril Lavigne and a song from",the,"movie Grease (1978)...WOW!!!!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
411,"""This is the first Marvel movie in a long time that didn't make me want to fast-forward to the end. It runs on fan service, cameos and everything that came before. I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit. This movie isn't going to fix anything like a lot of people thought it would. Not as good as 1, but better than 2. I'll probably watch it again.""",Neutral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
412,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
413,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors. But hey, Deadpool & Wolverine has plenty to look out for.

425,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6. This film I kind of count as a stand-alone film and not a """"Deadpool 3"""", the first 2 in my opinion are much more enjoyable.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
426,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film. And that says a lot.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fact I'm giving them 2 starts on top of the 4 just because it was funny is crazy.I don't know when Marvel will learn that this multi-verse is ruining them. They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wolverine wearing the suit was great but the line """"Friends don't let friends leave home looking like they fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams."""" is incredible. The constant shots at other studios or the failures of marvel since Endgame was funny & something I wasn't sure we'd see in a Marvel Studios production but it made it even better.

If you loved the first two, you're going to love this, if you didn't then I'd skip it as it really cranks up what makes deadpool, deadpool. The movie is one big Easter egg so make sure you're locked in to everything going on. One of my favourite lines in the film """"Pegging isn't new for me, but it is for Disney"""" perfect delivery.

436,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic!

437,"""This is the first Marvel movie in a long time that didn't make me want to fast-forward to the end. It runs on fan service, cameos and everything that came before. I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit.

438,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
439,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors.

The """"corridor"""" type of fight scene (that's in fact in a street) around the end the movie, it's just...a banquet of madness.Plus, the soundtrack is -like in the previous movies- super satisfying.I am quite excited for what there is to come next in the MCU and for these characters we've seen in this movie...""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
446,"""We've waited so long for this moment, and it was beyond fun, wholesome, full of surprises, emotional and epic! Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman and Shawn Levy pour out their hearts for this movie to be what is it.It's beyond the MCU timeline, it's beyond even FOX's """"X-Men"""" movies. It's about all the kids who grew up with these movies and these characters. The kids, who are now adults, but still love every bit of it.You know it's going to be fun with these two, but man... I laughed so hard, even my stomach was feeling it. And the jokes... be sure this is not Deadpool watered down in the MCU, it's Deadpool at its best. The inevitable bromance unveiled before our eyes. The story is fine, nothing special, but you feel it, and knowing the past knowledge about these characters and their respective universes makes everything hit the emotions.What about the cameos, you'd ask, I guess? Well, we already know about a bunch of them, but be sure, there's a bunch more and even the ones we already knew are more than what meets the eye.Emma Corrin as the villain Cassandra Nova is such a good addition to the movie and to the MCU as a whole. She is smart, strong, cold-blooded and also makes fun of our two leads.The action and the visuals are beyond amazing. There are some really, really creative scenes, where adamantium swords and claws create such a mayhem, that makes everything so bloody!The music choice is great and fun, at times could crack you so much. The opening scene is pure gold!Can't praise the movie enough, but """"Deadpool & Wolverine"""" is definitely in my top 5 cinema experiences, and you can easily guess the other ones. The whole theater was laughing, cheering and sobbing like a one person. What more could you ask for? Also, the movie got such a rewatchability factor, the length is perfect and be sure it will make tons of money! You can't possibly catch all the details in the first viewing for sure, but you will want to, so you'll go again and again... and again.What about the credit scene, you might ask? I kind of don't want to say anything about it because I don't want to spoil even the possible direction your thought is taking. Just stay for it, also during the credits there is something really beautiful. It's nowhere near """"fun filler"""", it's not """"Infinity War"""" level too, but it's a great movie, and it's one of MCU's finest!""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

451,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6. This film I kind of count as a stand-alone film and not a """"Deadpool 3"""", the first 2 in my opinion are much more enjoyable.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
452,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film.

They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wolverine wearing the suit was great but the line """"Friends don't let friends leave home looking like they fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams."""" is incredible.

462,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic!

It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit.

464,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
465,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane.

It's about all the kids who grew up with these movies and these characters. The kids, who are now adults, but still love every bit of it.You know it's going to be fun with these two, but man...

477,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6.

478,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film.

They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

488,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic! Hearing Green",Positive,life whilst showing behind,the scenes footage of the fox/marvel,films was a really heartfelt goodbye,"to the Fox universe. Instead of insulting them, it was a celebration of them and felt like",a fitting,"goodbye.Anyways, as",much,as Deadpool and Wolverine is a,messy,movie with a,"flawed story,",its just,too,fun to really,care to,much,about that. The fact that this exists is,just so cool for comic book fans and,I had an absolute blast watching the midnight premiere and even my,rewatch,of it.Oh I forgot,"to mention how this had an absolute GOATED soundtrack, Green Day, Avril Lavigne and a song from",the,"movie Grease (1978)...WOW!!!!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
489,"""This is the first Marvel movie in a long time that didn't make me want to fast-forward to the end. It runs on fan service, cameos and everything that came before. I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit. This movie isn't going to fix anything like a lot of people thought it would. Not as good as 1, but better than 2. I'll probably watch it again.""",Neutral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
490,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
491,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors. But hey, Deadpool & Wolverine has plenty to look out for.

When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6.

504,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film.

They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

507,"""So that was a trip. I really enjoyed that film, and think both casual and hardcore fans will be pleased. Not perfect, but still pretty darn entertaining. There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cameos are, as far as I'm concerned, awesome as well.And one more thing - pacing is also spot on - 2 hours flew by.I'll keep it short - just go and watch it!""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The constant fourth wall breaking was timed perfectly & constant laughs along the way. It was a wonderful tribute throughout to some of the forgotten heroes in other films. Wolverine wearing the suit was great but the line """"Friends don't let friends leave home looking like they fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams."""" is incredible. The constant shots at other studios or the failures of marvel since Endgame was funny & something I wasn't sure we'd see in a Marvel Studios production but it made it even better. The whole movie is really just a bunch of fun as you'd expect with some epic action sequences along the way. If you loved the first two, you're going to love this, if you didn't then I'd skip it as it really cranks up what makes deadpool, deadpool. The movie is one big Easter egg so make sure you're locked in to everything going on. One of my favourite lines in the film """"Pegging isn't new for me, but it is for Disney"""" perfect delivery.

514,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic! Hearing Green",Positive,life whilst showing behind,the scenes footage of the fox/marvel,films was a really heartfelt goodbye,"to the Fox universe.

515,"""This is the first Marvel movie in a long time that didn't make me want to fast-forward to the end. It runs on fan service, cameos and everything that came before. I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit. This movie isn't going to fix anything like a lot of people thought it would. Not as good as 1, but better than 2.

516,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
517,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors.

The story can be a little confusing, but it was fun all the way, I didn't feel bored even for a second. The action was very bloody and goofy, the jokes were hardcore and the movie is very meta. The one thing I especially liked is that there are actually emotional scene that aren't actually undercut with jokes, a thing that a lot of newer MCU movies tend to do. But this is still more of a Fox than a MCU movie. If you liked previous Deadpool movies you'll like this one too.

529,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6. This film I kind of count as a stand-alone film and not a """"Deadpool 3"""", the first 2 in my opinion are much more enjoyable.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
530,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film. And that says a lot.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

540,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic!

It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit.

542,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
543,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors.

The motivation for why the TVA chose Deadpool is a bit weak, and the story of how Wolverine left the X-Men hanging is also too brief.3. Some scenes with Peter could have been omitted.""",Neutral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The movie was full of unsuspected moments (that I wont spoil). I went with my mom who does not know anything about marvel (only Spiderman) but had no problems following a few jokes here and there about moments from past films but nothing to worry about not being able to follow the movie.

549,"What I can say about this movie is that they (the whole team behind the movie) never hesitated a second to go all in, with everything they have in stores, throwing the kitchen sink in there and everything else.What's to love is how highly satisfying the movie is from the very first to the very last second, when it comes to all the little (or not so little) winks at the audience, especially if you connect with the characters and their previous iterations...But what you can really appreciate and which makes the entire movie (and scenes / story bits) more enjoyable is the whole emotional layer of it and really fun connections that occur (the come-back or introduction of various characters was so well done and really great to see) ...These guys clearly know what they are doing.Between the one-liners and the endless flow of jokes... The chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman knocks it out of the park !It is so overflowingly cray-cray and the frame is oh so overfilled with stuffs...Oh, and the tone of the movie is something else !The intro sequence is a masterpiece... The """"corridor"""" type of fight scene (that's in fact in a street) around the end the movie, it's just...a banquet of madness.Plus, the soundtrack is -like in the previous movies- super satisfying.I am quite excited for what there is to come next in the MCU and for these characters we've seen in this movie...""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman and Shawn Levy pour out their hearts for this movie to be what is it.It's beyond the MCU timeline, it's beyond even FOX's """"X-Men"""" movies. It's about all the kids who grew up with these movies and these characters. The kids, who are now adults, but still love every bit of it.You know it's going to be fun with these two, but man... I laughed so hard, even my stomach was feeling it. And the jokes... be sure this is not Deadpool watered down in the MCU, it's Deadpool at its best. The inevitable bromance unveiled before our eyes. The story is fine, nothing special, but you feel it, and knowing the past knowledge about these characters and their respective universes makes everything hit the emotions.What about the cameos, you'd ask, I guess? Well, we already know about a bunch of them, but be sure, there's a bunch more and even the ones we already knew are more than what meets the eye.Emma Corrin as the villain Cassandra Nova is such a good addition to the movie and to the MCU as a whole. She is smart, strong, cold-blooded and also makes fun of our two leads.The action and the visuals are beyond amazing. There are some really, really creative scenes, where adamantium swords and claws create such a mayhem, that makes everything so bloody!The music choice is great and fun, at times could crack you so much. The opening scene is pure gold!Can't praise the movie enough, but """"Deadpool & Wolverine"""" is definitely in my top 5 cinema experiences, and you can easily guess the other ones. The whole theater was laughing, cheering and sobbing like a one person. What more could you ask for? Also, the movie got such a rewatchability factor, the length is perfect and be sure it will make tons of money! You can't possibly catch all the details in the first viewing for sure, but you will want to, so you'll go again and again... and again.What about the credit scene, you might ask? I kind of don't want to say anything about it because I don't want to spoil even the possible direction your thought is taking. Just stay for it, also during the credits there is something really beautiful.

555,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6. This film I kind of count as a stand-alone film and not a """"Deadpool 3"""", the first 2 in my opinion are much more enjoyable.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
556,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film. And that says a lot.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wolverine wearing the suit was great but the line """"Friends don't let friends leave home looking like they fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams."""" is incredible. The constant shots at other studios or the failures of marvel since Endgame was funny & something I wasn't sure we'd see in a Marvel Studios production but it made it even better.

If you loved the first two, you're going to love this, if you didn't then I'd skip it as it really cranks up what makes deadpool, deadpool.

566,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic!

It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit.

The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
569,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors. But hey, Deadpool & Wolverine has plenty to look out for.

When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6.

582,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film.

The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

589,"""I felt like the story was weak and obviously things were happening just to progress the plot versus making sense. Charles sister one moment is touched because 1 of the infinite number of Charles might have cared she existed and releasing them from the void, to instantly following them to destroy everything just because she was written to.That being said if you just enjoy the cultural references and ride without thinking, it's a good film.

I never felt more excited and so happy with joy as I am right now!!!Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, are way OVER THE TOP with their BEST performances!

The ACTION, the COMEDY, the SPECTACLE, the JOKES, the GORE, and every best Marvel moments was beautifully well done by the book when it comes to Kevin Feige, and along with the MCU team, that can actually make many Marvel movies possible, to keep Stan Lee's name and his legacy alive!Shawn Levy, who made Free Guy, Night at the Museum films, Real Steel, and The Adam Project, did a really great job making his version of Deadpool happen on the BIG SCREEN, and we finally got what the Marvel fans wanted!

Don't get me wrong, Ryan Reynolds does a phenomenal job, and the some scenes are just way to hilarious.

592,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic! Hearing Green",Positive,life whilst showing behind,the scenes footage of the fox/marvel,films was a really heartfelt goodbye,"to the Fox universe. Instead of insulting them, it was a celebration of them and felt like",a fitting,"goodbye.Anyways, as",much,as Deadpool and Wolverine is a,messy,movie with a,"flawed story,",its just,too,fun to really,care to,much,about that. The fact that this exists is,just so cool for comic book fans and,I had an absolute blast watching the midnight premiere and even my,rewatch,of it.Oh I forgot,"to mention how this had an absolute GOATED soundtrack, Green Day, Avril Lavigne and a song from",the,"movie Grease (1978)...WOW!!!!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
593,"""This is the first Marvel movie in a long time that didn't make me want to fast-forward to the end. It runs on fan service, cameos and everything that came before. I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit. This movie isn't going to fix anything like a lot of people thought it would. Not as good as 1, but better than 2. I'll probably watch it again.""",Neutral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
594,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
595,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors. But hey, Deadpool & Wolverine has plenty to look out for.

607,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6. This film I kind of count as a stand-alone film and not a """"Deadpool 3"""", the first 2 in my opinion are much more enjoyable.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
608,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film. And that says a lot.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fact I'm giving them 2 starts on top of the 4 just because it was funny is crazy.I don't know when Marvel will learn that this multi-verse is ruining them. They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wolverine wearing the suit was great but the line """"Friends don't let friends leave home looking like they fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams."""" is incredible. The constant shots at other studios or the failures of marvel since Endgame was funny & something I wasn't sure we'd see in a Marvel Studios production but it made it even better.

If you loved the first two, you're going to love this, if you didn't then I'd skip it as it really cranks up what makes deadpool, deadpool. The movie is one big Easter egg so make sure you're locked in to everything going on. One of my favourite lines in the film """"Pegging isn't new for me, but it is for Disney"""" perfect delivery.

618,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic!

619,"""This is the first Marvel movie in a long time that didn't make me want to fast-forward to the end. It runs on fan service, cameos and everything that came before. I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit.

620,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
621,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors.

The """"corridor"""" type of fight scene (that's in fact in a street) around the end the movie, it's just...a banquet of madness.Plus, the soundtrack is -like in the previous movies- super satisfying.I am quite excited for what there is to come next in the MCU and for these characters we've seen in this movie...""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
628,"""We've waited so long for this moment, and it was beyond fun, wholesome, full of surprises, emotional and epic! Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman and Shawn Levy pour out their hearts for this movie to be what is it.It's beyond the MCU timeline, it's beyond even FOX's """"X-Men"""" movies. It's about all the kids who grew up with these movies and these characters. The kids, who are now adults, but still love every bit of it.You know it's going to be fun with these two, but man... I laughed so hard, even my stomach was feeling it. And the jokes... be sure this is not Deadpool watered down in the MCU, it's Deadpool at its best. The inevitable bromance unveiled before our eyes. The story is fine, nothing special, but you feel it, and knowing the past knowledge about these characters and their respective universes makes everything hit the emotions.What about the cameos, you'd ask, I guess? Well, we already know about a bunch of them, but be sure, there's a bunch more and even the ones we already knew are more than what meets the eye.Emma Corrin as the villain Cassandra Nova is such a good addition to the movie and to the MCU as a whole. She is smart, strong, cold-blooded and also makes fun of our two leads.The action and the visuals are beyond amazing. There are some really, really creative scenes, where adamantium swords and claws create such a mayhem, that makes everything so bloody!The music choice is great and fun, at times could crack you so much. The opening scene is pure gold!Can't praise the movie enough, but """"Deadpool & Wolverine"""" is definitely in my top 5 cinema experiences, and you can easily guess the other ones. The whole theater was laughing, cheering and sobbing like a one person. What more could you ask for? Also, the movie got such a rewatchability factor, the length is perfect and be sure it will make tons of money! You can't possibly catch all the details in the first viewing for sure, but you will want to, so you'll go again and again... and again.What about the credit scene, you might ask? I kind of don't want to say anything about it because I don't want to spoil even the possible direction your thought is taking. Just stay for it, also during the credits there is something really beautiful. It's nowhere near """"fun filler"""", it's not """"Infinity War"""" level too, but it's a great movie, and it's one of MCU's finest!""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

633,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6. This film I kind of count as a stand-alone film and not a """"Deadpool 3"""", the first 2 in my opinion are much more enjoyable.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
634,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film.

They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wolverine wearing the suit was great but the line """"Friends don't let friends leave home looking like they fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams."""" is incredible. The constant shots at other studios or the failures of marvel since Endgame was funny & something I wasn't sure we'd see in a Marvel Studios production but it made it even better.

644,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic!

I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit.

646,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
647,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane.

It's about all the kids who grew up with these movies and these characters. The kids, who are now adults, but still love every bit of it.You know it's going to be fun with these two, but man...

Well, we already know about a bunch of them, but be sure, there's a bunch more and even the ones we already knew are more than what meets the eye.Emma Corrin as the villain Cassandra Nova is such a good addition to the movie and to the MCU as a whole. She is smart, strong, cold-blooded and also makes fun of our two leads.The action and the visuals are beyond amazing.

659,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6.

660,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film.

They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

670,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic! Hearing Green",Positive,life whilst showing behind,the scenes footage of the fox/marvel,films was a really heartfelt goodbye,"to the Fox universe. Instead of insulting them, it was a celebration of them and felt like",a fitting,"goodbye.Anyways, as",much,as Deadpool and Wolverine is a,messy,movie with a,"flawed story,",its just,too,fun to really,care to,much,about that. The fact that this exists is,just so cool for comic book fans and,I had an absolute blast watching the midnight premiere and even my,rewatch,of it.Oh I forgot,"to mention how this had an absolute GOATED soundtrack, Green Day, Avril Lavigne and a song from",the,"movie Grease (1978)...WOW!!!!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
671,"""This is the first Marvel movie in a long time that didn't make me want to fast-forward to the end. It runs on fan service, cameos and everything that came before. I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit. This movie isn't going to fix anything like a lot of people thought it would. Not as good as 1, but better than 2. I'll probably watch it again.""",Neutral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
672,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
673,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors. But hey, Deadpool & Wolverine has plenty to look out for.

When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6.

686,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film.

They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

689,"""So that was a trip. I really enjoyed that film, and think both casual and hardcore fans will be pleased. Not perfect, but still pretty darn entertaining. There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cameos are, as far as I'm concerned, awesome as well.And one more thing - pacing is also spot on - 2 hours flew by.I'll keep it short - just go and watch it!""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The constant fourth wall breaking was timed perfectly & constant laughs along the way. It was a wonderful tribute throughout to some of the forgotten heroes in other films. Wolverine wearing the suit was great but the line """"Friends don't let friends leave home looking like they fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams."""" is incredible. The constant shots at other studios or the failures of marvel since Endgame was funny & something I wasn't sure we'd see in a Marvel Studios production but it made it even better. The whole movie is really just a bunch of fun as you'd expect with some epic action sequences along the way. If you loved the first two, you're going to love this, if you didn't then I'd skip it as it really cranks up what makes deadpool, deadpool. The movie is one big Easter egg so make sure you're locked in to everything going on. One of my favourite lines in the film """"Pegging isn't new for me, but it is for Disney"""" perfect delivery.

Don't get me wrong, Ryan Reynolds does a phenomenal job, and the some scenes are just way to hilarious.

696,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic! Hearing Green",Positive,life whilst showing behind,the scenes footage of the fox/marvel,films was a really heartfelt goodbye,"to the Fox universe.

697,"""This is the first Marvel movie in a long time that didn't make me want to fast-forward to the end. It runs on fan service, cameos and everything that came before. I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit. This movie isn't going to fix anything like a lot of people thought it would. Not as good as 1, but better than 2.

698,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
699,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors.

Ridiculous deaths, sarcasms, obnoxious non PC comments and most importantly the most amazing music which brings it all together.And Deapool and Wolverine has that on every possible way.If you want to see this film, go to the cinema, don't wait for TV because you will miss one of the biggest and best watches to ever hit the big screen.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The story can be a little confusing, but it was fun all the way, I didn't feel bored even for a second. The action was very bloody and goofy, the jokes were hardcore and the movie is very meta. The one thing I especially liked is that there are actually emotional scene that aren't actually undercut with jokes, a thing that a lot of newer MCU movies tend to do. But this is still more of a Fox than a MCU movie. If you liked previous Deadpool movies you'll like this one too.

I won't spoil anything, but there were multiple cameos by characters you'll never see in any other movie, and I loved them.

711,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6. This film I kind of count as a stand-alone film and not a """"Deadpool 3"""", the first 2 in my opinion are much more enjoyable.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
712,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film. And that says a lot.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

722,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic!

It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit.

724,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
725,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors.

The motivation for why the TVA chose Deadpool is a bit weak, and the story of how Wolverine left the X-Men hanging is also too brief.3. Some scenes with Peter could have been omitted.""",Neutral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The movie was full of unsuspected moments (that I wont spoil). I went with my mom who does not know anything about marvel (only Spiderman) but had no problems following a few jokes here and there about moments from past films but nothing to worry about not being able to follow the movie.

Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman and Shawn Levy pour out their hearts for this movie to be what is it.It's beyond the MCU timeline, it's beyond even FOX's """"X-Men"""" movies. It's about all the kids who grew up with these movies and these characters. The kids, who are now adults, but still love every bit of it.You know it's going to be fun with these two, but man... I laughed so hard, even my stomach was feeling it. And the jokes... be sure this is not Deadpool watered down in the MCU, it's Deadpool at its best. The inevitable bromance unveiled before our eyes.

Well, we already know about a bunch of them, but be sure, there's a bunch more and even the ones we already knew are more than what meets the eye.Emma Corrin as the villain Cassandra Nova is such a good addition to the movie and to the MCU as a whole. She is smart, strong, cold-blooded and also makes fun of our two leads.The action and the visuals are beyond amazing. There are some really, really creative scenes, where adamantium swords and claws create such a mayhem, that makes everything so bloody!The music choice is great and fun, at times could crack you so much. The opening scene is pure gold!Can't praise the movie enough, but """"Deadpool & Wolverine"""" is definitely in my top 5 cinema experiences, and you can easily guess the other ones. The whole theater was laughing, cheering and sobbing like a one person. What more could you ask for? Also, the movie got such a rewatchability factor, the length is perfect and be sure it will make tons of money! You can't possibly catch all the details in the first viewing for sure, but you will want to, so you'll go again and again... and again.What about the credit scene, you might ask? I kind of don't want to say anything about it because I don't want to spoil even the possible direction your thought is taking.

737,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6. This film I kind of count as a stand-alone film and not a """"Deadpool 3"""", the first 2 in my opinion are much more enjoyable.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
738,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film. And that says a lot.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wolverine wearing the suit was great but the line """"Friends don't let friends leave home looking like they fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams."""" is incredible. The constant shots at other studios or the failures of marvel since Endgame was funny & something I wasn't sure we'd see in a Marvel Studios production but it made it even better.

748,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic!

The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
751,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors. But hey, Deadpool & Wolverine has plenty to look out for.

When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6.

764,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film.

The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

771,"""I felt like the story was weak and obviously things were happening just to progress the plot versus making sense. Charles sister one moment is touched because 1 of the infinite number of Charles might have cared she existed and releasing them from the void, to instantly following them to destroy everything just because she was written to.That being said if you just enjoy the cultural references and ride without thinking, it's a good film. There are many hilarious scenes and great fight scenes along with beautifully shot scenes. I saw it in imax 3d in Indy and the effects were really solid as well.

The ACTION, the COMEDY, the SPECTACLE, the JOKES, the GORE, and every best Marvel moments was beautifully well done by the book when it comes to Kevin Feige, and along with the MCU team, that can actually make many Marvel movies possible, to keep Stan Lee's name and his legacy alive!Shawn Levy, who made Free Guy, Night at the Museum films, Real Steel, and The Adam Project, did a really great job making his version of Deadpool happen on the BIG SCREEN, and we finally got what the Marvel fans wanted!

Don't get me wrong, Ryan Reynolds does a phenomenal job, and the some scenes are just way to hilarious.

774,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic! Hearing Green",Positive,life whilst showing behind,the scenes footage of the fox/marvel,films was a really heartfelt goodbye,"to the Fox universe. Instead of insulting them, it was a celebration of them and felt like",a fitting,"goodbye.Anyways, as",much,as Deadpool and Wolverine is a,messy,movie with a,"flawed story,",its just,too,fun to really,care to,much,about that. The fact that this exists is,just so cool for comic book fans and,I had an absolute blast watching the midnight premiere and even my,rewatch,of it.Oh I forgot,"to mention how this had an absolute GOATED soundtrack, Green Day, Avril Lavigne and a song from",the,"movie Grease (1978)...WOW!!!!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
775,"""This is the first Marvel movie in a long time that didn't make me want to fast-forward to the end. It runs on fan service, cameos and everything that came before. I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit. This movie isn't going to fix anything like a lot of people thought it would. Not as good as 1, but better than 2. I'll probably watch it again.""",Neutral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
776,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
777,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors. But hey, Deadpool & Wolverine has plenty to look out for.

789,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6. This film I kind of count as a stand-alone film and not a """"Deadpool 3"""", the first 2 in my opinion are much more enjoyable.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
790,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film. And that says a lot.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fact I'm giving them 2 starts on top of the 4 just because it was funny is crazy.I don't know when Marvel will learn that this multi-verse is ruining them. They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wolverine wearing the suit was great but the line """"Friends don't let friends leave home looking like they fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams."""" is incredible. The constant shots at other studios or the failures of marvel since Endgame was funny & something I wasn't sure we'd see in a Marvel Studios production but it made it even better.

If you loved the first two, you're going to love this, if you didn't then I'd skip it as it really cranks up what makes deadpool, deadpool. The movie is one big Easter egg so make sure you're locked in to everything going on. One of my favourite lines in the film """"Pegging isn't new for me, but it is for Disney"""" perfect delivery.

800,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic!

801,"""This is the first Marvel movie in a long time that didn't make me want to fast-forward to the end. It runs on fan service, cameos and everything that came before. I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit. This movie isn't going to fix anything like a lot of people thought it would. Not as good as 1, but better than 2.

802,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
803,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors.

The """"corridor"""" type of fight scene (that's in fact in a street) around the end the movie, it's just...a banquet of madness.Plus, the soundtrack is -like in the previous movies- super satisfying.I am quite excited for what there is to come next in the MCU and for these characters we've seen in this movie...""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
810,"""We've waited so long for this moment, and it was beyond fun, wholesome, full of surprises, emotional and epic! Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman and Shawn Levy pour out their hearts for this movie to be what is it.It's beyond the MCU timeline, it's beyond even FOX's """"X-Men"""" movies. It's about all the kids who grew up with these movies and these characters. The kids, who are now adults, but still love every bit of it.You know it's going to be fun with these two, but man... I laughed so hard, even my stomach was feeling it. And the jokes... be sure this is not Deadpool watered down in the MCU, it's Deadpool at its best. The inevitable bromance unveiled before our eyes. The story is fine, nothing special, but you feel it, and knowing the past knowledge about these characters and their respective universes makes everything hit the emotions.What about the cameos, you'd ask, I guess? Well, we already know about a bunch of them, but be sure, there's a bunch more and even the ones we already knew are more than what meets the eye.Emma Corrin as the villain Cassandra Nova is such a good addition to the movie and to the MCU as a whole. She is smart, strong, cold-blooded and also makes fun of our two leads.The action and the visuals are beyond amazing. There are some really, really creative scenes, where adamantium swords and claws create such a mayhem, that makes everything so bloody!The music choice is great and fun, at times could crack you so much. The opening scene is pure gold!Can't praise the movie enough, but """"Deadpool & Wolverine"""" is definitely in my top 5 cinema experiences, and you can easily guess the other ones. The whole theater was laughing, cheering and sobbing like a one person. What more could you ask for? Also, the movie got such a rewatchability factor, the length is perfect and be sure it will make tons of money! You can't possibly catch all the details in the first viewing for sure, but you will want to, so you'll go again and again... and again.What about the credit scene, you might ask? I kind of don't want to say anything about it because I don't want to spoil even the possible direction your thought is taking. Just stay for it, also during the credits there is something really beautiful. It's nowhere near """"fun filler"""", it's not """"Infinity War"""" level too, but it's a great movie, and it's one of MCU's finest!""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

815,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6. This film I kind of count as a stand-alone film and not a """"Deadpool 3"""", the first 2 in my opinion are much more enjoyable.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
816,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film.

They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wolverine wearing the suit was great but the line """"Friends don't let friends leave home looking like they fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams."""" is incredible. The constant shots at other studios or the failures of marvel since Endgame was funny & something I wasn't sure we'd see in a Marvel Studios production but it made it even better.

826,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic!

It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit.

828,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
829,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane.

It's about all the kids who grew up with these movies and these characters. The kids, who are now adults, but still love every bit of it.You know it's going to be fun with these two, but man...

Well, we already know about a bunch of them, but be sure, there's a bunch more and even the ones we already knew are more than what meets the eye.Emma Corrin as the villain Cassandra Nova is such a good addition to the movie and to the MCU as a whole. She is smart, strong, cold-blooded and also makes fun of our two leads.The action and the visuals are beyond amazing.

The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6.

842,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film.

They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

852,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic! Hearing Green",Positive,life whilst showing behind,the scenes footage of the fox/marvel,films was a really heartfelt goodbye,"to the Fox universe. Instead of insulting them, it was a celebration of them and felt like",a fitting,"goodbye.Anyways, as",much,as Deadpool and Wolverine is a,messy,movie with a,"flawed story,",its just,too,fun to really,care to,much,about that. The fact that this exists is,just so cool for comic book fans and,I had an absolute blast watching the midnight premiere and even my,rewatch,of it.Oh I forgot,"to mention how this had an absolute GOATED soundtrack, Green Day, Avril Lavigne and a song from",the,"movie Grease (1978)...WOW!!!!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
853,"""This is the first Marvel movie in a long time that didn't make me want to fast-forward to the end. It runs on fan service, cameos and everything that came before. I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit. This movie isn't going to fix anything like a lot of people thought it would. Not as good as 1, but better than 2. I'll probably watch it again.""",Neutral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
854,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
855,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors. But hey, Deadpool & Wolverine has plenty to look out for.

When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6.

868,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film.

I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

871,"""So that was a trip. I really enjoyed that film, and think both casual and hardcore fans will be pleased. Not perfect, but still pretty darn entertaining. There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cameos are, as far as I'm concerned, awesome as well.And one more thing - pacing is also spot on - 2 hours flew by.I'll keep it short - just go and watch it!""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wolverine wearing the suit was great but the line """"Friends don't let friends leave home looking like they fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams."""" is incredible. The constant shots at other studios or the failures of marvel since Endgame was funny & something I wasn't sure we'd see in a Marvel Studios production but it made it even better. The whole movie is really just a bunch of fun as you'd expect with some epic action sequences along the way. If you loved the first two, you're going to love this, if you didn't then I'd skip it as it really cranks up what makes deadpool, deadpool. The movie is one big Easter egg so make sure you're locked in to everything going on. One of my favourite lines in the film """"Pegging isn't new for me, but it is for Disney"""" perfect delivery.

878,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic!

879,"""This is the first Marvel movie in a long time that didn't make me want to fast-forward to the end. It runs on fan service, cameos and everything that came before. I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit. This movie isn't going to fix anything like a lot of people thought it would. Not as good as 1, but better than 2.

880,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
881,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors.

Ridiculous deaths, sarcasms, obnoxious non PC comments and most importantly the most amazing music which brings it all together.And Deapool and Wolverine has that on every possible way.If you want to see this film, go to the cinema, don't wait for TV because you will miss one of the biggest and best watches to ever hit the big screen.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The story can be a little confusing, but it was fun all the way, I didn't feel bored even for a second. The action was very bloody and goofy, the jokes were hardcore and the movie is very meta. The one thing I especially liked is that there are actually emotional scene that aren't actually undercut with jokes, a thing that a lot of newer MCU movies tend to do. But this is still more of a Fox than a MCU movie. If you liked previous Deadpool movies you'll like this one too.

I won't spoil anything, but there were multiple cameos by characters you'll never see in any other movie, and I loved them.

893,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6. This film I kind of count as a stand-alone film and not a """"Deadpool 3"""", the first 2 in my opinion are much more enjoyable.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
894,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film. And that says a lot.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wolverine wearing the suit was great but the line """"Friends don't let friends leave home looking like they fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams."""" is incredible. The constant shots at other studios or the failures of marvel since Endgame was funny & something I wasn't sure we'd see in a Marvel Studios production but it made it even better.

904,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic!

It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit.

906,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
907,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors.

The motivation for why the TVA chose Deadpool is a bit weak, and the story of how Wolverine left the X-Men hanging is also too brief.3. Some scenes with Peter could have been omitted.""",Neutral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It did not make a lot of sense but I did not really matter, in the moment it was fun and funny! The jakes went a little further then normally to be honest but if you are a Deadpool fan that means extra fun! The movie started off great! And ended even greater! The movie was full of unsuspected moments (that I wont spoil). I went with my mom who does not know anything about marvel (only Spiderman) but had no problems following a few jokes here and there about moments from past films but nothing to worry about not being able to follow the movie.

913,"What I can say about this movie is that they (the whole team behind the movie) never hesitated a second to go all in, with everything they have in stores, throwing the kitchen sink in there and everything else.What's to love is how highly satisfying the movie is from the very first to the very last second, when it comes to all the little (or not so little) winks at the audience, especially if you connect with the characters and their previous iterations...But what you can really appreciate and which makes the entire movie (and scenes / story bits) more enjoyable is the whole emotional layer of it and really fun connections that occur (the come-back or introduction of various characters was so well done and really great to see) ...These guys clearly know what they are doing.Between the one-liners and the endless flow of jokes... The chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman knocks it out of the park !It is so overflowingly cray-cray and the frame is oh so overfilled with stuffs...Oh, and the tone of the movie is something else !The intro sequence is a masterpiece... The """"corridor"""" type of fight scene (that's in fact in a street) around the end the movie, it's just...a banquet of madness.Plus, the soundtrack is -like in the previous movies- super satisfying.I am quite excited for what there is to come next in the MCU and for these characters we've seen in this movie...""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman and Shawn Levy pour out their hearts for this movie to be what is it.It's beyond the MCU timeline, it's beyond even FOX's """"X-Men"""" movies. It's about all the kids who grew up with these movies and these characters. The kids, who are now adults, but still love every bit of it.You know it's going to be fun with these two, but man... I laughed so hard, even my stomach was feeling it. And the jokes... be sure this is not Deadpool watered down in the MCU, it's Deadpool at its best. The inevitable bromance unveiled before our eyes. The story is fine, nothing special, but you feel it, and knowing the past knowledge about these characters and their respective universes makes everything hit the emotions.What about the cameos, you'd ask, I guess? Well, we already know about a bunch of them, but be sure, there's a bunch more and even the ones we already knew are more than what meets the eye.Emma Corrin as the villain Cassandra Nova is such a good addition to the movie and to the MCU as a whole. She is smart, strong, cold-blooded and also makes fun of our two leads.The action and the visuals are beyond amazing. There are some really, really creative scenes, where adamantium swords and claws create such a mayhem, that makes everything so bloody!The music choice is great and fun, at times could crack you so much. The opening scene is pure gold!Can't praise the movie enough, but """"Deadpool & Wolverine"""" is definitely in my top 5 cinema experiences, and you can easily guess the other ones. The whole theater was laughing, cheering and sobbing like a one person. What more could you ask for? Also, the movie got such a rewatchability factor, the length is perfect and be sure it will make tons of money! You can't possibly catch all the details in the first viewing for sure, but you will want to, so you'll go again and again... and again.What about the credit scene, you might ask? I kind of don't want to say anything about it because I don't want to spoil even the possible direction your thought is taking. Just stay for it, also during the credits there is something really beautiful.

The one thing I especially liked is that there are actually emotional scene that aren't actually undercut with jokes, a thing that a lot of newer MCU movies tend to do. But this is still more of a Fox than a MCU movie. If you liked previous Deadpool movies you'll like this one too.

919,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6. This film I kind of count as a stand-alone film and not a """"Deadpool 3"""", the first 2 in my opinion are much more enjoyable.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
920,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film. And that says a lot.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fact I'm giving them 2 starts on top of the 4 just because it was funny is crazy.I don't know when Marvel will learn that this multi-verse is ruining them. They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wolverine wearing the suit was great but the line """"Friends don't let friends leave home looking like they fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams."""" is incredible. The constant shots at other studios or the failures of marvel since Endgame was funny & something I wasn't sure we'd see in a Marvel Studios production but it made it even better.

If you loved the first two, you're going to love this, if you didn't then I'd skip it as it really cranks up what makes deadpool, deadpool.

930,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic!

It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit.

The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
933,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors. But hey, Deadpool & Wolverine has plenty to look out for.

It's about all the kids who grew up with these movies and these characters. The kids, who are now adults, but still love every bit of it.You know it's going to be fun with these two, but man...

Well, we already know about a bunch of them, but be sure, there's a bunch more and even the ones we already knew are more than what meets the eye.Emma Corrin as the villain Cassandra Nova is such a good addition to the movie and to the MCU as a whole.

When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6.

946,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film.

I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

953,"""I felt like the story was weak and obviously things were happening just to progress the plot versus making sense. Charles sister one moment is touched because 1 of the infinite number of Charles might have cared she existed and releasing them from the void, to instantly following them to destroy everything just because she was written to.That being said if you just enjoy the cultural references and ride without thinking, it's a good film. There are many hilarious scenes and great fight scenes along with beautifully shot scenes. I saw it in imax 3d in Indy and the effects were really solid as well.

I never felt more excited and so happy with joy as I am right now!!!Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, are way OVER THE TOP with their BEST performances!

The ACTION, the COMEDY, the SPECTACLE, the JOKES, the GORE, and every best Marvel moments was beautifully well done by the book when it comes to Kevin Feige, and along with the MCU team, that can actually make many Marvel movies possible, to keep Stan Lee's name and his legacy alive!Shawn Levy, who made Free Guy, Night at the Museum films, Real Steel, and The Adam Project, did a really great job making his version of Deadpool happen on the BIG SCREEN, and we finally got what the Marvel fans wanted!

Don't get me wrong, Ryan Reynolds does a phenomenal job, and the some scenes are just way to hilarious.

956,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic! Hearing Green",Positive,life whilst showing behind,the scenes footage of the fox/marvel,films was a really heartfelt goodbye,"to the Fox universe. Instead of insulting them, it was a celebration of them and felt like",a fitting,"goodbye.Anyways, as",much,as Deadpool and Wolverine is a,messy,movie with a,"flawed story,",its just,too,fun to really,care to,much,about that. The fact that this exists is,just so cool for comic book fans and,I had an absolute blast watching the midnight premiere and even my,rewatch,of it.Oh I forgot,"to mention how this had an absolute GOATED soundtrack, Green Day, Avril Lavigne and a song from",the,"movie Grease (1978)...WOW!!!!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
957,"""This is the first Marvel movie in a long time that didn't make me want to fast-forward to the end. It runs on fan service, cameos and everything that came before. I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit. This movie isn't going to fix anything like a lot of people thought it would. Not as good as 1, but better than 2. I'll probably watch it again.""",Neutral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
958,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
959,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors. But hey, Deadpool & Wolverine has plenty to look out for.

971,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6. This film I kind of count as a stand-alone film and not a """"Deadpool 3"""", the first 2 in my opinion are much more enjoyable.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
972,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film. And that says a lot.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fact I'm giving them 2 starts on top of the 4 just because it was funny is crazy.I don't know when Marvel will learn that this multi-verse is ruining them. They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wolverine wearing the suit was great but the line """"Friends don't let friends leave home looking like they fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams."""" is incredible. The constant shots at other studios or the failures of marvel since Endgame was funny & something I wasn't sure we'd see in a Marvel Studios production but it made it even better.

If you loved the first two, you're going to love this, if you didn't then I'd skip it as it really cranks up what makes deadpool, deadpool. The movie is one big Easter egg so make sure you're locked in to everything going on. One of my favourite lines in the film """"Pegging isn't new for me, but it is for Disney"""" perfect delivery.

982,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic!

983,"""This is the first Marvel movie in a long time that didn't make me want to fast-forward to the end. It runs on fan service, cameos and everything that came before. I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit.

984,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
985,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors.

The """"corridor"""" type of fight scene (that's in fact in a street) around the end the movie, it's just...a banquet of madness.Plus, the soundtrack is -like in the previous movies- super satisfying.I am quite excited for what there is to come next in the MCU and for these characters we've seen in this movie...""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
992,"""We've waited so long for this moment, and it was beyond fun, wholesome, full of surprises, emotional and epic! Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman and Shawn Levy pour out their hearts for this movie to be what is it.It's beyond the MCU timeline, it's beyond even FOX's """"X-Men"""" movies. It's about all the kids who grew up with these movies and these characters. The kids, who are now adults, but still love every bit of it.You know it's going to be fun with these two, but man... I laughed so hard, even my stomach was feeling it. And the jokes... be sure this is not Deadpool watered down in the MCU, it's Deadpool at its best. The inevitable bromance unveiled before our eyes. The story is fine, nothing special, but you feel it, and knowing the past knowledge about these characters and their respective universes makes everything hit the emotions.What about the cameos, you'd ask, I guess? Well, we already know about a bunch of them, but be sure, there's a bunch more and even the ones we already knew are more than what meets the eye.Emma Corrin as the villain Cassandra Nova is such a good addition to the movie and to the MCU as a whole. She is smart, strong, cold-blooded and also makes fun of our two leads.The action and the visuals are beyond amazing. There are some really, really creative scenes, where adamantium swords and claws create such a mayhem, that makes everything so bloody!The music choice is great and fun, at times could crack you so much. The opening scene is pure gold!Can't praise the movie enough, but """"Deadpool & Wolverine"""" is definitely in my top 5 cinema experiences, and you can easily guess the other ones. The whole theater was laughing, cheering and sobbing like a one person. What more could you ask for? Also, the movie got such a rewatchability factor, the length is perfect and be sure it will make tons of money! You can't possibly catch all the details in the first viewing for sure, but you will want to, so you'll go again and again... and again.What about the credit scene, you might ask? I kind of don't want to say anything about it because I don't want to spoil even the possible direction your thought is taking. Just stay for it, also during the credits there is something really beautiful. It's nowhere near """"fun filler"""", it's not """"Infinity War"""" level too, but it's a great movie, and it's one of MCU's finest!""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The one thing I especially liked is that there are actually emotional scene that aren't actually undercut with jokes, a thing that a lot of newer MCU movies tend to do. But this is still more of a Fox than a MCU movie. If you liked previous Deadpool movies you'll like this one too.

997,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6. This film I kind of count as a stand-alone film and not a """"Deadpool 3"""", the first 2 in my opinion are much more enjoyable.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
998,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film. And that says a lot.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fact I'm giving them 2 starts on top of the 4 just because it was funny is crazy.I don't know when Marvel will learn that this multi-verse is ruining them. They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wolverine wearing the suit was great but the line """"Friends don't let friends leave home looking like they fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams."""" is incredible. The constant shots at other studios or the failures of marvel since Endgame was funny & something I wasn't sure we'd see in a Marvel Studios production but it made it even better.

If you loved the first two, you're going to love this, if you didn't then I'd skip it as it really cranks up what makes deadpool, deadpool. The movie is one big Easter egg so make sure you're locked in to everything going on. One of my favourite lines in the film """"Pegging isn't new for me, but it is for Disney"""" perfect delivery.

1008,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic!

I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit.

1010,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1011,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors.

The trailers after the second one weren't necessary; based on the final trailer, I expected a bit more but was cautious.2.

The chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman knocks it out of the park !It is so overflowingly cray-cray and the frame is oh so overfilled with stuffs...Oh, and the tone of the movie is something else !The intro sequence is a masterpiece... The """"corridor"""" type of fight scene (that's in fact in a street) around the end the movie, it's just...a banquet of madness.Plus, the soundtrack is -like in the previous movies- super satisfying.I am quite excited for what there is to come next in the MCU and for these characters we've seen in this movie...""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman and Shawn Levy pour out their hearts for this movie to be what is it.It's beyond the MCU timeline, it's beyond even FOX's """"X-Men"""" movies. It's about all the kids who grew up with these movies and these characters. The kids, who are now adults, but still love every bit of it.You know it's going to be fun with these two, but man... I laughed so hard, even my stomach was feeling it. And the jokes... be sure this is not Deadpool watered down in the MCU, it's Deadpool at its best. The inevitable bromance unveiled before our eyes. The story is fine, nothing special, but you feel it, and knowing the past knowledge about these characters and their respective universes makes everything hit the emotions.What about the cameos, you'd ask, I guess? Well, we already know about a bunch of them, but be sure, there's a bunch more and even the ones we already knew are more than what meets the eye.Emma Corrin as the villain Cassandra Nova is such a good addition to the movie and to the MCU as a whole. She is smart, strong, cold-blooded and also makes fun of our two leads.The action and the visuals are beyond amazing. There are some really, really creative scenes, where adamantium swords and claws create such a mayhem, that makes everything so bloody!The music choice is great and fun, at times could crack you so much. The opening scene is pure gold!Can't praise the movie enough, but """"Deadpool & Wolverine"""" is definitely in my top 5 cinema experiences, and you can easily guess the other ones. The whole theater was laughing, cheering and sobbing like a one person. What more could you ask for? Also, the movie got such a rewatchability factor, the length is perfect and be sure it will make tons of money! You can't possibly catch all the details in the first viewing for sure, but you will want to, so you'll go again and again... and again.What about the credit scene, you might ask? I kind of don't want to say anything about it because I don't want to spoil even the possible direction your thought is taking.

The one thing I especially liked is that there are actually emotional scene that aren't actually undercut with jokes, a thing that a lot of newer MCU movies tend to do.

1023,"""I feel i'm in the minority here but I can't bring myself to rate this film over a 6, which feels such a shame. The first 2 Deadpool's are some of my all time favourite films, they're easy to watch, fun, hilarious, plenty of heart. When the credits rolled for Deadpool and Wolverine I thought to myself, would I watch this again? Probably not and I can't put my finger on why this one just felt so off? I'm not taking anything away from the acting of Deadpool or Wolverine as both gave their all during this but the story completely let them down. I've seen people say """"oh it's Deadpool don't read into these films too much, just enjoy them"""" in a sense that's true but the first 2 films had a coherent story and plot which are very engaging. Watching 2 immortal beings consistently insult then fight each other 6/7 times throughout can get a bit repetitive and I felt that around halfway through. Where was Collusus? Megasonic? Dulpinder? I wish we had so much more of these guys but they had about 5 minute screen time throughout the whole film. The problem with this Multiverse BS is the lack of stakes, anything is possible where some things should have an end and plot armour becomes so stale. The cameos I honestly couldn't care for, Marvel need to stop shoe horning in old characters for the hope of making the audience giddy and focus on a compelling plot and story. I wanted to love this film as much as everyone else but I can't lie to myself. The acting was good (props to Cassandra, she was cool), some funny moments and some good action made it a solid 6. This film I kind of count as a stand-alone film and not a """"Deadpool 3"""", the first 2 in my opinion are much more enjoyable.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1024,"""D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film. And that says a lot.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fact I'm giving them 2 starts on top of the 4 just because it was funny is crazy.I don't know when Marvel will learn that this multi-verse is ruining them. They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that.

There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.""",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wolverine wearing the suit was great but the line """"Friends don't let friends leave home looking like they fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams."""" is incredible. The constant shots at other studios or the failures of marvel since Endgame was funny & something I wasn't sure we'd see in a Marvel Studios production but it made it even better.

But what do I know?I say go for it, and at least you end up laughing.""",Neutrral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1034,"""After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself """"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU"""".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic! Hearing Green",Positive,life whilst showing behind,the scenes footage of the fox/marvel,films was a really heartfelt goodbye,"to the Fox universe. Instead of insulting them, it was a celebration of them and felt like",a fitting,"goodbye.Anyways, as",much,as Deadpool and Wolverine is a,messy,movie with a,"flawed story,",its just,too,fun to really,care to,much,about that. The fact that this exists is,just so cool for comic book fans and,I had an absolute blast watching the midnight premiere and even my,rewatch,of it.Oh I forgot,"to mention how this had an absolute GOATED soundtrack, Green Day, Avril Lavigne and a song from",the,"movie Grease (1978)...WOW!!!!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1035,"""This is the first Marvel movie in a long time that didn't make me want to fast-forward to the end. It runs on fan service, cameos and everything that came before. I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit. This movie isn't going to fix anything like a lot of people thought it would. Not as good as 1, but better than 2. I'll probably watch it again.""",Neutral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1036,"""My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of """"oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."""" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.""",Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1037,"""Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors. But hey, Deadpool & Wolverine has plenty to look out for. The stakes are higher, the villain is formidable and the titular characters' arcs are just golden.Deadpool being Deadpool, it's such a treat watching",Positive,really feels like Deadpool,is directing this movie.

1038,"""And to understand some of the Easter eggs, jokes, and scenes, you even need to know about planned or canceled movies. There are various superheroes who appeared that I didn't expect, but some that I did expect did not make an appearance. It's a must-see for all Marvel fans. The fight choreography, music, jokes, Easter eggs, and CGI were really great.Here are a few negatives about the movie.1. The trailers after the second one weren't necessary; based on the final trailer, I expected a bit more but was cautious.2. The motivation for why the TVA chose Deadpool is a bit weak, and the story of how Wolverine left the X-Men hanging is also too brief.3.

1040,"""Awesome movie! Lot of funny humor. Multiple occasions where the whole room started laughing. Great story! It did not make a lot of sense but I did not really matter, in the moment it was fun and funny! The jakes went a little further then normally to be honest but if you are a Deadpool fan that means extra fun! The movie started off great! And ended even greater! The movie was full of unsuspected moments (that I wont spoil). I went with my mom who does not know anything about marvel (only Spiderman) but had no problems following a few jokes here and there about moments from past films but nothing to worry about not being able to follow the movie.
